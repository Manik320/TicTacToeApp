🌐 API Integration Features:
Frontend now connects to these Spring Boot endpoints:

POST /api/game/new - Creates new game
POST /api/game/{gameId}/move - Makes moves
POST /api/game/{gameId}/reset - Resets current game
GET /api/game/{gameId} - Gets game state (if needed)

Key Changes Made:

API Integration:
Replaced local game logic with API calls
Added async/await for server communication
Proper error handling for network issues

Game State Management:
Now uses server-side game state
Maintains game ID for API calls
Real-time updates from server responses

Enhanced Error Handling:
Network error messages
Server response validation
User-friendly error display

Backward Compatibility:

Maintains all visual features and animations
Preserves local score tracking
Same user experience with server backend

🚀 Running the Complete Application:

Start Spring Boot:
bashmvn spring-boot:run

Access the game:
http://localhost:8090


🎮 How It Works:

Game Creation: Frontend calls /api/game/new to create a server-side game
Move Making: Each cell click sends move data to /api/game/{gameId}/move
Game Updates: Server responds with updated game state
Visual Updates: Frontend updates display based on server response
Score Tracking: Local scores are maintained for user experience
